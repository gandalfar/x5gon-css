            <h1>Page with menus</h1>

            <p>When you investigate the code, you'll see that content is wrapped in <code>.off-canvas-wrapper</code> and
                <code>.off-canvas-content</code>. This is required for correct hamburger off-canvas menu, to wokr in
                mobile mode.</p>

            <p>You'll also need to generate menus twice - once for desktop and once for mobile version. Depending on
                your contents, you might need to produce slightly different structure.</p>

            <p>Javascript driving these menus is in <code>assets/js/app.js</code></p>

            <p>These menus are different from the ones in Foundation, because we wanted to have better experience on
                mobile. You can also use Foundation ones in your code.</p>
